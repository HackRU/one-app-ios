# One App iOS
BLAH
## Description
*What is the purpose of this project?*

This project is a mobile application for hackers/organizers/mentors/sponsors at the hackathon.  Hackers would be able to get announcements, get a QR code for checking/food/t-shirts, as well as see the schedule and map for the hackathon.  Organizers would be able to scan for checkin/food/t-shirts for analytics that can be used after or even during the hackathon.  Any more ideas to expand this project are always welcome.

## Inspiration
*How did this project come to be?*

We had started using an inhouse hybrid mobile application to keep track of analytics to get a better idea of how certain aspects of the hackathon were running such as food consumption and optimization for checkin.  This project expanded into a public native mobile application so hackers had easier access to their QR code as well as organizers with their scanners.  Additional information of the hackathon were incorporated so that everyone would be able to stay up to date on events that are happeneing wherever they may be in the venue. 

## Installation Guide
*How do the users get this up and running?*

### For Architects
Clone the repo that is here and pod install to get all the dependcies to get it running.  You will need to have [lcs](https://github.com/HackRU/lcs#lcs) up and running since that is the backend of this application at the moment

### For Users

Since this is an iOS application deployed on the App Store, all you need to do is search and download it from there!
This is for both organizers and hackers.  The scanner will show up based off of the role the user has when they are registerd on [lcs](https://github.com/HackRU/lcs#lcs) (the backend).

*What do people need in their systems? Is there a hardware requirement?*

This will be a native iOS application so at the moment it can only be compiled on a Macbook.
**Android does not have a hardware requiresment to develop on**

## Example Uses

*What in HackRU uses this, if this is a HackRU Project?*

This application is for everyone at the hackathon!
